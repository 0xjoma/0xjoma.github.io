<p>At my organization, access to restricted content is controlled with an allow list of IP addresses. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">allow_list.txt</code> file identifies these IP addresses. A separate remove list identifies IP addresses that should no longer have access to this content. I created an algorithm to automate updating the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">allow_list.txt</code> file and remove these IP addresses that should no longer have access.</p>

<h2 id="open-the-file-that-contains-the-allow-list">Open The File That Contains The Allow List</h2>

<p>For the first part of the algorithm, I opened the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">allow_list.txt</code> file. First, I assigned this file name as a string to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">import_file</code> variable:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="c1"># Assign `import_file` to the name of the file
</span>
 <span class="n">import_file</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"allow_list.txt"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Then, I used a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with</code> statement to open the file:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Build `with` statement to read the name in the initial contents of the file
</span>
<span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">import_file</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"r"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="nb">file</span><span class="p">:</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In my algorithm, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with</code> statement is used with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.open()</code> function in read mode to open the allow list file for the purpose of reading it. The purpose of opening the file is to allow me to access the IP addresses stored in the allow list file. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with</code> keyword will help manage the resources by closing the file after exiting the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with</code> statement. In the code <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with open(import_file, "r") as file:</code>, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">open()</code> function has two parameters. The first identifies the file to import, and then the second indicates what I want to do with the file. In this case, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"r"</code> indicates that I want to read it. The code also uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">as</code> keyword to assign a variable named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file</code>; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file</code> stores the output of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.open()</code> function while I work within the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with</code> statement.</p>

<h2 id="read-the-file-contents">Read The File Contents</h2>

<p>In order to read the file contents, I used the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.read()</code> method to convert it into the string.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">import_file</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"r"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="nb">file</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="c1"># Use `.read()` to read the imported file and store it in a variable named `ip_addresses`
</span>
    <span class="n">ip_addresses</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">file</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">read</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When using an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.open()</code> function that includes the argument <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"r"</code> for “read,” I can call the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.read()</code> function in the body of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with</code> statement. The .<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">read()</code> method converts the file into a string and allows me to read it. I applied the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.read()</code> method to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file</code> variable identified in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with</code> statement. Then, I assigned the string output of this method to the variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ip_addresses</code>.</p>

<p>In summary, this code reads the contents of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"allow_list.txt"</code> file into a string format that allows me to later use the string to organize and extract data in my Python program.</p>

<h2 id="convert-the-string-into-a-list">Convert The String Into A List</h2>

<p>In order to remove individual IP addresses from the allow list, I needed it to be in list format. Therefore, I next used the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.split()</code> method to convert the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ip_addresses</code> string into a list:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Use `.split()` to convert `ip_addresses` from a string to a list
</span>
<span class="n">ip_addresses</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ip_addresses</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.split()</code> function is called by appending it to a string variable. It works by converting the contents of a string to a list. The purpose of splitting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ip_addresses</code> into a list is to make it easier to remove IP addresses from the allow list. By default, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.split()</code> function splits the text by whitespace into list elements. In this algorithm, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.split()</code> function takes the data stored in the variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ip_addresses</code>, which is a string of IP addresses that are each separated by a whitespace, and it converts this string into a list of IP addresses. To store this list, I reassigned it back to the variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ip_addresses</code>.</p>

<h2 id="iterate-through-the-remove-list">Iterate Through The Remove List</h2>

<p>A key part of my algorithm involves iterating through the IP addresses that are elements in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">remove_list</code>. To do this, I incorporated a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code> loop:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Build iterative statement
# Name loop variable `element`
# Loop through `remove_list`
</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">element</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">remove_list</span><span class="p">:</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code> loop in Python repeats code for a specified sequence. The overall purpose of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code> loop in a Python algorithm like this is to apply specific code statements to all elements in a sequence. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code> keyword starts the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code> loop. It is followed by the loop variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">element</code> and the keyword <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">in</code>. The keyword <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">in</code> indicates to iterate through the sequence <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ip_addresses</code> and assign each value to the loop variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">element</code>.</p>

<h2 id="remove-ip-addresses-that-are-on-the-remove-list">Remove IP Addresses That Are On The Remove List</h2>

<p>My algorithm requires removing any IP address from the allow list, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ip_addresses</code>, that is also contained in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">remove_list</code>.  Because there were not any duplicates in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ip_addresses</code>, I was able to use the following code to do this:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">element</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">remove_list</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="c1"># Create conditional statement to evaluate if `element` is in `ip_addresses`
</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">element</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">ip_addresses</span><span class="p">:</span>
           <span class="c1"># use the `.remove()` method to remove
</span>           <span class="c1"># elements from `ip_addresses`
</span>
               <span class="n">ip_addresses</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">remove</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">element</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>First, within my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code> loop, I created a conditional that evaluated whether or not the loop variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">element</code> was found in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ip_addresses</code> list. I did this because applying <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.remove()</code> to elements that were not found in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ip_addresses</code> would result in an error.</p>

<p>Then, within that conditional, I applied <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.remove()</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ip_addresses</code>. I passed in the loop variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">element</code> as the argument so that each IP address that was in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">remove_list</code> would be removed from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ip_addresses</code>.</p>

<h2 id="update-the-file-with-the-revised-list-of-ip-addresses">Update The File With The Revised List Of IP Addresses</h2>

<p>As a final step in my algorithm, I needed to update the allow list file with the revised list of IP addresses. To do so, I first needed to convert the list back into a string. I used the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.join()</code> method for this:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Convert `ip_addresses` back to a string so that it can be written into the text file
</span>
<span class="n">ip_addresses</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ip_addresses</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.join()</code> method combines all items in an iterable into a string. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.join()</code> method is applied to a string containing characters that will separate the elements in the iterable once joined into a string. In this algorithm, I used the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.join()</code> method to create a string from the list <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ip_addresses</code> so that I could pass it in as an argument to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.write()</code> method when writing to the file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"allow_list.txt"</code>. I used the string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">("\n")</code> as the separator to instruct Python to place each element on a new line.</p>

<p>Then, I used another <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with</code> statement and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.write()</code> method to update the file:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Build `with` statement to rewrite the original file
</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">import_file</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"w"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="nb">file</span><span class="p">:</span>

        <span class="c1"># Rewrite the file, replacing its contents with `ip_addresses`
</span>
        <span class="nb">file</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ip_addresses</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This time, I used a second argument of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"w"</code> with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">open()</code> function in my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with</code> statement. This argument indicates that I want to open a file to write over its contents. When using this argument <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"w"</code>, I can call the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.write()</code> function in the body of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with</code> statement. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.write()</code> function writes string data to a specified file and replaces any existing file content.</p>

<p>In this case I wanted to write the updated allow list as a string to the file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"allow_list.txt"</code>. This way, the restricted content will no longer be accessible to any IP addresses that were removed from the allow list. To rewrite the file, I appended the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.write()</code> function to the file object <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file</code> that I identified in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with</code> statement. I passed in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ip_addresses</code> variable as the argument to specify that the contents of the file specified in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with</code> statement should be replaced with the data in this variable.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>I created an algorithm that removes IP addresses identified in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">remove_list</code> variable from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"allow_list.txt"</code> file of approved IP addresses. This algorithm involved opening the file, converting it to a string to be read, and then converting this string to a list stored in the variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ip_addresses</code>. I then iterated through the IP addresses in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">remove_list</code>. With each iteration, I evaluated if the element was part of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ip_addresses</code> list. If it was, I applied the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.remove()</code> method to it to remove the element from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ip_addresses</code>.. After this, I used the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.join()</code> method to convert the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ip_addresses</code> back into a string so that I could write over the contents of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"allow_list.txt"</code> file with the revised list of IP addresses.</p>

<p>My organization is working to make their system more secure. It is my job to ensure the system is safe, investigate all potential security issues, and update employee computers as needed. The following steps provide examples of how I used SQL with filters to perform security-related tasks.</p>

<h2 id="retrieve-after-hours-failed-login-attempts">Retrieve After Hours Failed Login Attempts</h2>

<p>There was a potential security incident that occurred after business hours (after 18:00). All after hours login attempts that failed need to be investigated.</p>

<p>The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for failed login attempts that occurred after business hours.</p>

<p><img src="/assets\apply-filters-sql-queries\retrieve-after-hours-failed-login-attempts.png" alt="A screenshot of an SQL query to filter for failed login attempts that occurred after business hours." /></p>

<p>The first part of the screenshot is my query, and the second part is a portion of the output. This query filters for failed login attempts that occurred after 18:00. First, I started by selecting all data from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log_in_attempts</code> table. Then, I used a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WHERE</code>clause with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AND</code> operator to filter my results to output only login attempts that occurred after 18:00 and were unsuccessful. The first condition is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">login_time &gt; '18:00',</code> which filters for the login attempts that occurred after 18:00. The second condition is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">success = FALSE</code>, which filters for the failed login attempts.</p>

<h2 id="retrieve-login-attempts-on-specific-dates">Retrieve Login Attempts On Specific Dates</h2>

<p>A suspicious event occurred on 2022-05-09. Any login activity that happened on 2022-05-09 or on the day before needs to be investigated.</p>

<p>The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for login attempts that occurred on specific dates.</p>

<p><img src="/assets\apply-filters-sql-queries\filter-login-attempts-specific-dates.png" alt="A screenshot of an SQL query to filter for login attempts that occurred on specific dates." /></p>

<p>The first part of the screenshot is my query, and the second part is a portion of the output. This query returns all login attempts that occurred on 2022-05-09 or 2022-05-08. First, I started by selecting all data from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log_in_attempts</code> table. Then, I used a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WHERE</code> clause with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OR</code> operator to filter my results to output only login attempts that occurred on either 2022-05-09 or 2022-05-08. The first condition is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">login_date = '2022-05-09'</code>, which filters for logins on 2022-05-09. The second condition is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">login_date = '2022-05-08'</code>, which filters for logins on 2022-05-08.</p>

<h2 id="retrieve-login-attempts-outside-of-mexico">Retrieve Login Attempts outside of Mexico</h2>

<p>After investigating the organization’s data on login attempts, I believe there is an issue with the login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico. These login attempts should be investigated.</p>

<p>The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico.</p>

<p><img src="/assets\apply-filters-sql-queries\filter-login-attempts-outside-mexico.png" alt="A screenshot of an SQL query to filter for login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico." /></p>

<p>The first part of the screenshot is my query, and the second part is a portion of the output. This query returns all login attempts that occurred in countries other than Mexico. First, I started by selecting all data from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log_in_attempts</code> table. Then, I used a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WHERE</code> clause with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NOT</code> to filter for countries other than Mexico. I used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LIKE</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MEX%</code> as the pattern to match because the dataset represents Mexico as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MEX</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MEXICO</code>. The percentage sign (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%</code>) represents any number of unspecified characters when used with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LIKE</code>.</p>

<h2 id="retrieve-employees-in-marketing">Retrieve Employees In Marketing</h2>

<p>My team wants to update the computers for certain employees in the Marketing department. To do this, I have to get information on which employee machines to update.</p>

<p>The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for employee machines from employees in the Marketing department in the East building.</p>

<p><img src="/assets\apply-filters-sql-queries\retrieve-employees-in-marketing.png" alt="A screenshot of an SQL query to filter for employee machines from employees in the Marketing department in the East building." /></p>

<p>The first part of the screenshot is my query, and the second part is a portion of the output. This query returns all employees in the Marketing department in the East building. First, I started by selecting all data from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">employees</code> table. Then, I used a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WHERE</code>clause with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AND</code> to filter for employees who work in the Marketing department and in the East building. I used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LIKE</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">East%</code> as the pattern to match because the data in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">office</code> column represents the East building with the specific office number. The first condition is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">department = 'Marketing'</code> portion, which filters for employees in the Marketing department. The second condition is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">office LIKE 'East%'</code> portion, which filters for employees in the East building.</p>

<h2 id="retrieve-employees-in-finance-or-sales">Retrieve Employees In Finance Or Sales</h2>

<p>The machines for employees in the Finance and Sales departments also need to be updated. Since a different security update is needed, I have to get information on employees only from these two departments.</p>

<p>The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for employee machines from employees in the Finance or Sales departments.</p>

<p><img src="/assets\apply-filters-sql-queries\retrieve-employees-in-finance-or-sales.png" alt="A screenshot of an SQL query to filter for employee machines from employees in the Finance or Sales departments." /></p>

First, I started by selecting all data from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">employees</code> table. Then, I used a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WHERE</code> clause with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OR</code> to filter for employees who are in the Finance and Sales departments. I used the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OR</code> operator instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AND</code> because I want all employees who are in either department. The first condition is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">department = 'Finance'</code>, which filters for employees from the Finance department. The second condition is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">department = 'Sales'</code>, which filters for employees from the Sales department.</p>

<h2 id="retrieve-all-employees-not-in-it">Retrieve All Employees Not In IT</h2>

<p>My team needs to make one more security update on employees who are not in the Information Technology department. To make the update, I first have to get information on these employees.</p>

<p>The following demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for employee machines from employees not in the  Information Technology department.</p>

<p><img src="/assets\apply-filters-sql-queries\employees-not-in-it.png" alt="A screenshot of an SQL query to filter for employee machines from employees not in the Information Technology department." /></p>

Then, I used a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WHERE</code> clause with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NOT</code> to filter for employees not in this department.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>I applied filters to SQL queries to get specific information on login attempts and employee machines. I used two different tables, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log_in_attempts</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">employees</code>. I used the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AND</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OR</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NOT</code> operators to filter for the specific information needed for each task. I also used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LIKE</code> and the percentage sign (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%</code>) wildcard to filter for patterns.</p>

<p>The research team at my organization needs to update the file permissions for certain files and directories within the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">projects</code> directory. The permissions do not currently reflect the level of authorization that should be given. Checking and updating these permissions will help keep their system secure. To complete this task, I performed the following tasks:</p>

<h2 id="check-file-and-directory-details">Check File and Directory Details</h2>

<p>The following code demonstrates how I used Linux commands to determine the existing permissions set for a specific directory in the file system.</p>

<p><img src="/assets\file-permissions-in-linux\check-file-and-directory-details.png" alt="A screenshot of Linux commands to determine the existing permissions set for a specific directory in the file system." /></p>

<p>The first line of the screenshot displays the command I entered, and the other lines display the output. The code lists all contents of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">projects</code> directory. I used the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-la</code> option to display a detailed listing of the file contents that also returned hidden files. The output of my command indicates that there is one directory named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">drafts</code>, one hidden file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.project_x.txt</code>, and five other project files. The 10-character string in the first column represents the permissions set on each file or directory.</p>

<h2 id="describe-the-permissions-string">Describe the Permissions String</h2>

<p>The 10-character string can be deconstructed to determine who is authorized to access the file and their specific permissions. The characters and what they represent are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>1st character</strong>: This character is either a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d</code> or hyphen <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(-)</code> and indicates the file type. If it’s a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d</code>, it’s a directory. If it’s a hyphen
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(-)</code>, it’s a regular file.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>2nd-4th characters:</strong> These characters indicate the read <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(r)</code>, write <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(w)</code>, and execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(x)</code> permissions for the user. When one of these characters is a hyphen <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(-)</code> instead, it indicates that this permission is not granted to the user.</li>
  <li><strong>5th-7th characters:</strong> These characters indicate the read <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(r)</code>, write <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(w)</code>, and execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(x)</code> permissions for the group. When one of these characters is a hyphen <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(-)</code> instead, it indicates that this permission is not granted for the group.</li>
  <li><strong>8th-10th characters:</strong> These characters indicate the read <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(r)</code>, write <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(w)</code>, and execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(x)</code> permissions for other. This owner type consists of all other users on the system apart from the user and the group. When one of these characters is a hyphen <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(-)</code> instead, that indicates that this permission is not granted for other.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the file permissions for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">project_t.txt</code> are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-rw-rw-r--</code>. Since the first character is a hyphen <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(-)</code>, this indicates that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">project_t.txt</code> is a file, not a directory. The second, fifth, and eighth characters are all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r</code>, which indicates that user, group, and other all have read permissions. The third and sixth characters are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">w</code>, which indicates that only the user and group have write permissions. No one has execute permissions for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">project_t.txt</code>.</p>

<h2 id="change-file-permissions">Change File Permissions</h2>

<p>The organization determined that other shouldn’t have write access to any of their files. To comply with this, I referred to the file permissions that I previously returned. I determined <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">project_k.txt</code> must have the write access removed for other.</p>

<p>The following code demonstrates how I used Linux commands to do this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets\file-permissions-in-linux\change-file-permissions.png" alt="A screenshot of Linux commands to change file permissions." /></p>

<p>The first two lines of the screenshot display the commands I entered, and the other lines display the output of the second command. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod</code> command changes the permissions on files and directories. The first argument indicates what permissions should be changed, and the second argument specifies the file or directory. In this example, I removed write permissions from other for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">project_k.txt</code> file. After this, I used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -la</code> to review the updates I made.</p>

<h2 id="change-file-permissions-on-a-hidden-file">Change File Permissions On A Hidden File</h2>

<p>The research team at my organization recently archived <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">project_x.txt</code>. They do not want anyone to have write access to this project, but the user and group should have read access.</p>

<p>The following code demonstrates how I used Linux commands to change the permissions:</p>

<p><img src="/assets\file-permissions-in-linux\change-file-permissions-on-a-hidden-file.png" alt="A screenshot of Linux commands to change file permissions on a hidden file." /></p>

<p>The first two lines of the screenshot display the commands I entered, and the other lines display the output of the second command. I know <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.project_x.txt</code> is a hidden file because it starts with a period <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(.)</code>. In this example, I removed write permissions from the user and group, and added read permissions to the group. I removed write permissions from the user with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u-w</code>. Then, I removed write permissions from the group with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g-w</code>, and added read permissions to the group with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g+r</code>.</p>

<h2 id="change-directory-permissions">Change Directory Permissions</h2>

<p>My organization only wants the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">researcher2</code> user to have access to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">drafts</code> directory and its contents. This means that no one other than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">researcher2</code> should have execute permissions.</p>

<p>The following code demonstrates how I used Linux commands to change the permissions:</p>

<p><img src="/assets\file-permissions-in-linux\change-directory-permissions.png" alt="A screenshot of Linux commands to change directory permissions." /></p>

<p>The first two lines of the screenshot display the commands I entered, and the other lines display the output of the second command. I previously determined that the group had execute permissions, so I used the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod</code> command to remove them. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">researcher2</code> user already had execute permissions, so they did not need to be added.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>I changed multiple permissions to match the level of authorization my organization wanted for files and directories in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">projects</code> directory. The first step in this was using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -la</code> to check the permissions for the directory. This informed my decisions in the following steps. I then used the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod</code> command multiple times to change the permissions on files and directories.</p>
