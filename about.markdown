Hello! I'm Jomael Ortiz Perez, but you might know me as 0xjoma in the digital realm.

From a young age, I have been fascinated by the intricate dance of ones and zeros that power our world. 

This curiosity led me to delve deep into cybersecurity, where I am currently honing my skills and knowledge as a student. 
My journey in this field is driven by a passion for understanding the complexities of digital defense and a commitment to 
making the online world a safer place for everyone.

But I am not just about bytes and bits. I believe in the power of sharing knowledge, 
which is why I have created this space. Here, I chronicle my journey, share insights from my studies, 
and discuss the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity. Whether you are a fellow student, a seasoned expert, 
or just someone curious about cybersecurity, I hope my blog offers you valuable insights and perspectives.
      

Thank you for stopping by, and I invite you to join me on this exciting journey, from bytes to blogs!
