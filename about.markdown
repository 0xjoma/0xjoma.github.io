<!-- About me -->
Hello! My name is Jomael Ortiz Perez, and I am in the digital community as 0xjoma. 
From an early age, the rhythmic dance of ones and zeros orchestrating our digital world has captivated me. 
This intrigue propelled me into cybersecurity, where I am now sharpening my acumen as a student. 
Driven by a deep-seated passion for deciphering the intricacies of digital defense, 
I dedicate myself to fostering a safer online environment for all. 

Beyond the binary, I am a fervent advocate for knowledge sharing. 
This belief catalyzed the creation of this platform, where I document my cybersecurity voyage, 
disseminate insights gleaned from my academic exploration, and engage in discussions around the ever-evolving cybersecurity milieu. 
Whether you're a student, a seasoned professional, or a digital safety enthusiast, 
I aspire for this blog to provide valuable insights and fresh perspectives. 
I appreciate your visit and warmly invite you to join me on this thrilling expedition, from bytes to blogs!
